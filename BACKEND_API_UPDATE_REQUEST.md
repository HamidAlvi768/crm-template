# Backend API Update Request

## Subject: API Response Structure Update Required for Frontend Authentication Integration

Hi [Backend Engineer Name],

I'm working on integrating the frontend authentication system with your login API, and I've encountered an issue that requires a small adjustment to the API response structure.

## Current API Response
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Login successful",
    "data": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "testuser",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "session_id": "dhk4n63p2p7a402r4l2nk2ovp5"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-09-01 06:49:43"
}
```

## Required Changes

### 1. Add `token` field
The frontend expects a `token` field for authentication. Please add this alongside or instead of `session_id`:

```json
"data": {
    "id": 5,
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "session_id": "dhk4n63p2p7a402r4l2nk2ovp5",
    "token": "dhk4n63p2p7a402r4l2nk2ovp5"
}
```

### 2. Keep `username` field
The frontend UI will use the existing `username` field for display purposes. No additional profile fields are needed.

## Final Expected Response Structure
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Login successful",
    "data": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "testuser",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "session_id": "dhk4n63p2p7a402r4l2nk2ovp5",
        "token": "dhk4n63p2p7a402r4l2nk2ovp5"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-09-01 06:49:43"
}
```

## Alternative Solution
If you prefer to keep the current structure, I can update the frontend to handle `session_id` instead of `token`, but adding the `token` field would be more standard and future-proof.

## Priority
**Medium** - This is blocking the authentication flow from working properly.

## Impact
- Users cannot access protected routes after login
- Authentication state is not properly maintained
- Frontend shows "login failed" despite successful API response

Please let me know if you need any clarification or if you'd like me to adjust the frontend instead.

Thanks!

**Note:** The issue is that the frontend is expecting a `token` field that isn't present in the current API response, causing the authentication state to not update properly. The `username` field is sufficient for user display purposes.
